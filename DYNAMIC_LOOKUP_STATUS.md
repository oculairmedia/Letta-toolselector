# Dynamic Tool ID Lookup Status Report

## Summary
The dynamic tool ID lookup functionality has been successfully implemented across the toolselector components. The system now dynamically queries the Letta API to find the correct tool ID for `find_tools` instead of relying on hardcoded IDs.

## Components Status

### 1. Tool Selector MCP Server ✅
- **Location**: `/opt/stacks/lettatoolsselector/`
- **Status**: Running and healthy
- **Port**: 3020
- **Features**:
  - MCP server is running with the updated code
  - Environment variables (LETTA_API_URL, LETTA_PASSWORD) are properly configured
  - The server exposes the `find_tools` tool via MCP protocol
  - Health check endpoint is working

### 2. Dynamic Lookup Utility ✅
- **File**: `letta_tool_utils.py`
- **Locations**: 
  - `/opt/stacks/lettatoolsselector/letta_tool_utils.py`
  - `/opt/stacks/letta-webhook-receiver-new/letta_tool_utils.py`
- **Status**: Both files are identical and contain the dynamic lookup functionality
- **Features**:
  - `get_find_tools_id()`: Dynamically queries Letta API for tool ID
  - `get_find_tools_id_with_fallback()`: Provides fallback mechanism
  - Searches in order: agent tools → all tools → MCP servers
  - Falls back to hardcoded ID if dynamic lookup fails

### 3. Find Tools Scripts ✅
- **Files**:
  - `find_tools.py`: Basic implementation with dynamic lookup
  - `find_tools_enhanced.py`: Enhanced version with detailed responses and rule support
- **Status**: Both scripts use the dynamic lookup via `get_find_tools_id_with_fallback()`
- **Features**:
  - Automatically includes the dynamically found tool ID in keep_tools list
  - Passes agent_id to enable agent-specific tool lookup

### 4. Webhook Receiver ⚠️
- **Location**: `/opt/stacks/letta-webhook-receiver-new/`
- **Code Status**: Updated with dynamic lookup in source code
- **Deployment Status**: **NOT DEPLOYED** - Running container has old image without dynamic lookup
- **Issue**: The running container (`letta-webhook-receiver`) doesn't have `letta_tool_utils.py`
- **Fix Required**: Rebuild and redeploy the webhook receiver container

## Dynamic Lookup Flow

1. When `find_tools` is called with an `agent_id`:
   - First checks `/v1/agents/{agent_id}/tools` for attached tools
   - Then checks `/v1/tools` for all available tools
   - Finally checks `/v1/tools/mcp/servers/{server}/tools` for MCP tools
   
2. The lookup searches for tools with name `find_tools` (case-insensitive)
3. If found, returns the tool ID; otherwise falls back to hardcoded ID
4. The tool ID is always included in the `keep_tools` list to prevent self-removal

## Test Results

Testing the dynamic lookup directly:
```bash
python3 find_tools.py --query "test" --agent_id "agent-test-123"
```

Output shows:
- Successfully queries the Letta API endpoints
- Finds `find_tools` in the `toolfinder` MCP server
- Falls back to hardcoded ID when actual tool ID cannot be determined
- The 404 error is expected (test agent doesn't exist)

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action**: Rebuild and redeploy the webhook receiver container to include the dynamic lookup functionality

2. **Future Improvements**:
   - Add caching for tool ID lookups to reduce API calls
   - Implement better error handling for API failures
   - Consider storing the tool ID mapping in a configuration file

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Add logging to track dynamic lookup success/failure rates
   - Monitor API response times for the lookup queries

## Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in all deployments:
- `LETTA_API_URL`: The Letta API endpoint (e.g., `https://letta.oculair.ca/v1`)
- `LETTA_PASSWORD`: Authentication token for the Letta API

## Conclusion

The dynamic tool ID lookup is successfully implemented and working in the toolselector components. The only remaining task is to update the deployed webhook receiver container to use the new code with dynamic lookup support.
